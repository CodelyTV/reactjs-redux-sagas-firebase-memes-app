# Unit 6

Right know our application has the logic of registering a new user in the `src/containers/SignupForm`. In this unit we are going to improve our code separating that side-effects with `redux-sagas`. 

In addition to store, actions and reducers, redux comes with another important concept: **middlewares**.

> A middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, **talking to an asynchronous API**, routing, and more.

On its way:

> `redux-saga` is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

## Steps

### Initialize redux-sagas

### Registering user in a saga

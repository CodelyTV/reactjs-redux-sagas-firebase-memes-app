# Unit 8

In this unit we will create the section of the app responsible to add new memes and we will see how to query for memes to the [giphy](https://giphy.com/) service.

## Steps

### Before to start

Note, we start this unit with all the base components of our app created under `src/components` folder. You can see most of them in action running `$ yarn run storybook`.

Remember also to follow the steps described in *Unit 1* to get giphy API key.
